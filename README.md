# Back-to-Earth-Quiz
Built and programmed an interactive quiz using C++ and Qt. The quiz follows the story of an astronaut who is lost in space and must answer questions correctly to get back to Earth before time runs out (#Energy).

The quiz allows users to create a username the first time they play. The game has three levels, ranging from easy to hard, and the player must pass all levels to reach Earth.

At the end, players can view the leaderboard to see their ranking compared to all other players who have played the game.
